SCOPED is an NSF-funded project and part of the NSF CSSI program. 
The SCOPED project goal is to establish a novel hybrid cloud+HPC computational platform for use by the broader scientific community that combines large-scale processing and modeling of seismic data with a suite of open-source seismic codes. Continue reading to get the list of supported software.
